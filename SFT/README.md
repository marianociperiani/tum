# S-FFT



## Description

The main idea is to implement a real-time pipeline -this means streaming data directly from the sensor and meanwhile processing it with the Loihi- based on the Fourier transform for processing radar data with a neuromorphic chip. The application will be embedded in a mobile robot equipped with an automotive radar, Intel's Loihi chip, Intel's NUC computing board, and other elements.
